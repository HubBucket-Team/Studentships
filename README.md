# Studentships
Proposals for bio.tools studentships.

[ELIXIR Denmark](<http://elixir-node.cbs.dtu.dk/>) - the coordinating node of the [bio.tools](https://dev.bio.tools) project - has earmarked funds to support studentships to work on curation-focussed mini-projects for bio.tools.  Projects must have clear and quantifiable impact on bio.tools content, in terms of number of entries and / or content quality.  Projects can include developments of some tooling, so long as this contributes directly to the project goals.

For further information, see the [studentship scheme description](http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/studentships.html).
